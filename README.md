# Median

Example project with several implementations of median calculation.

Compiled with VS2017 or VS2019 (with loading CMakeLists.txt from File->Open->CMake..).

This will build a console application that runs Unit Tests for several containers in Debug
and Performance tests in Release. Also there is doxygen generated doc folder.

TODO
 - add more documentation
 - port and build with GCC for Linux (x86 and x64)
 - add two more containers
