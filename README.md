# Median

Example project with several implementations of median calculation:
<br> MedianVector - uses std::sort
<br> MedianNthElement - uses std::nth_element
<br> MedianVectorLBound - uses std::lower_bound
<br> MedianMultisetAdvance - uses std::multiset and std::advance
<br> MedianMultisetIterator - uses std::multiset with median iterator
<br> MedianRBTree - uses Red-Black tree
<br>
Compiled with VS2017 or later (with loading CMakeLists.txt from File->Open->CMake..).

This will build a console application that runs Unit Tests for several containers in Debug
and several Performance tests in Release.
