# Median

Example project with several implementations of median calculation.

Compiled with VS2017 or later (with loading CMakeLists.txt from File->Open->CMake..).

This will build a console application that runs Unit Tests for several containers in Debug
and several Performance tests in Release. 

TODO
 - add more documentation
 - port and build with GCC for Linux (x86 and x64)
